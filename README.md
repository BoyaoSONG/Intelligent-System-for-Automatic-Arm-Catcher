# Intelligent-System-for-Automatic-Arm-Catcher
Project of Polytech S9
This repository is a notebook for my personal school project (Polytech S9: ISAAC).
It contains: 
            1. Image processing with OpenCV: Detect color and shape, ROI, detect object center coordinates.
            2. Machine learning: Use Python with scikit-learn to build a classifier in order to analyze data. Send each object's location                  to robotic arm.
            3. Python with database.
