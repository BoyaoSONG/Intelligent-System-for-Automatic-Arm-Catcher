# Intelligent-System-for-Automatic-Arm-Catcher
Project of Polytech S9
<br>This repository is a notebook for my personal school project (Polytech S9: ISAAC).</br>
It contains: </br>
	1. Image processing with OpenCV: Detect color and shape, ROI, detect object center coordinates.</br>
	2. Machine learning: Use Python with scikit-learn to build a classifier in order to analyze data. Send each object's location to robotic arm.</br>
	3. Python with database.</br>
<br>Files and code contain main program of this project, dataset, model training program and parameter tuning process.</br>
